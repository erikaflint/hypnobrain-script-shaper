  "metaphor_selection_instructions": "Choose from library OR generate new metaphor following pattern: internal physical sensation of nourishment/protection. Must include: visceral belly/core sensation, warmth/coating/holding quality, explicit vagus nerve/nervous system safety signaling, permission to soften as result.",

    "Nourished from within",
    "A protective layer, gentle coating",
    "Held from the inside",
    "Your body recognizing: I'm fed, I'm safe",

  ],
  
  "prompt_integration": "Create vivid somatic experience of internal nourishment - warmth, coating, protective layer in belly/core. Link this physical sensation explicitly to vagus nerve signaling and nervous system downregulation. Emphasize body's recognition of being 'taken care of' which creates permission to soften and rest. Use slow, sensory-rich language. This is especially powerful for depleted/exhausted clients who can't rest because they feel 'empty' or 'running on fumes.' The internal nourishment creates the safety needed for rest.",
  
  "critical_note": "This arc works specifically because it addresses the body's deep need to feel RESOURCED before it can rest. Not just permission to rest (Oasis), but actual felt sense of being filled/nourished that makes rest possible. Particularly effective for people in chronic depletion who've lost connection to internal nourishment signals."
